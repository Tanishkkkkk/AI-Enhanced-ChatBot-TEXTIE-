🧠💬 TEXTIE
A Gen-Z Native AI Chatbot Running on Local LLMs

TEXTIE isn’t trained to sound smart.
It’s trained to sound human.

TEXTIE is a personality-first AI chatbot built on a locally hosted Large Language Model using LM Studio + Gamma AI.
It speaks casually, thinks fast, and runs completely offline.

No cloud.
No subscriptions.
No stiff, corporate replies.

Just conversation.

🌱 The Idea

Most AI chatbots optimize for knowledge density.
TEXTIE optimizes for vibe density.

This project explores a simple question:

What happens when we design AI around how people talk, not how machines think?

TEXTIE was created as an experiment in:

Gen-Z conversational patterns

Prompt-level personality shaping

Lightweight, local LLM execution

Human-centric AI design

🧩 What TEXTIE Does

💬 Chats naturally using Gen-Z tone and flow

🧠 Responds with personality, not templates

⚡ Runs fast using low context fragments

🔒 Works fully offline on local hardware

🛠️ Designed to be extended, not locked

Filtered, Tone-Aligned Response


TEXTIE doesn’t rely on heavy memory or large context windows.
Instead, it uses carefully crafted prompts and tight inference settings to stay responsive and expressive.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Model: Gamma AI

Runtime: LM Studio (Local LLM Hosting)

Language: Python

Inference Style: Lightweight, low-fragment context

Focus: Speed, personality, privacy

⚡ Why Local LLM?

Running TEXTIE locally means:

🚫 No API costs

🚫 No data leaving the machine

🚫 No dependency on internet

✅ Full control over behavior

✅ Real-time experimentation

This project demonstrates that small, well-tuned models can feel more human than massive, untamed ones.

🧪 What This Project Demonstrates

Practical usage of local LLMs

Prompt engineering beyond “system instructions”

Personality alignment at inference time

Designing AI for humans, not benchmarks

🚀 Future Directions

TEXTIE is intentionally simple, but not finished.

Planned evolutions:

🧠 Short-term and long-term memory

🎭 Emotion and intent detection

🤖 Agent-based task execution

🌐 Web / Mobile UI

🔁 Multi-model support
